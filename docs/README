Here are various documents describing the architecture and
various programs.

The picture SydneyUniversityPDS4Rom.png shows the output
of the ROM-60 program that checks the ROM from 040 to 077
against what it should be in a floppy system.  The rom was
turned off and the papertape boot loader was toggled in before
running the ROM-60 program, so the output shows the floppy
bootloader in the "correct" column and the papertape bootloader
in the "actual" column.  This is from the PDS-4 that was at
Sydney University in 1978.
