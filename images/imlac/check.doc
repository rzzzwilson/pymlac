	THERE ARE SEVERAL OPTIONS TO THE GAME WHICH CAN BE INDICATED
BY THE DATA SWITCH SETTINGS WHEN THE PROGRAM IS STARTED OR RESTARTED:
 
		BITS	FUNCTION
		----    --------
 
		0	STOP PROGRAM IF DOWN
		7-12	DETERMINE THE LEVEL OF RECURSION WHEN THE
			COMPUTER IS FIGURING OUT A MOVE
 
		13	COMPUTER PLAYS ITSELF
 
		14	INPPT A GAME STATE
 
		15	DISPLAY MOVES WHICH COMPUTER IS

	THE KEYBOARD IS THE ONY OTHER SOERCE OF INPUT TO THE PROGRAM.
THE CURSOR IS CONTROLLED VIA THE CURSOR CONTROL KEYS.  (THINK OF THE
ARROWS ON THESE KEYS AS IF THEY WERE ROTATED 45 DEGREES COUNTER-
CLOCKWISE.)  TO MAKE A MOVE THE OPERATOR MUST POINT THE CURSOR AT
THE CHECKER HE WISHES TO MOVE AND TYPE A C; THEN HE MUST MOVE THE
CURSOR TO WHERE HE WANTS TO MOVE THAT CHECKER AND TYPE AN M.
IN ORDER TO JUMP, THE OPERATOR MUST TYPE THE C WHIL POINTING AT HIS
CHECKER, THEN MOVE THE CURSOR THE HIS LANDING SPOT (IF IT IS MORE THAN
A SINGLE JUMP) AND TYPE ANOTHERJ, ETC...., AND FINALLY WHEN HE HAS
SPECIFIED HIS ENTIRE PATH, HE MUST TYPE A CAPITAL J.
 
	A GAME MAY BE ABORTED MOST OF THE TIME BY TYPING CR.
 
	THE COMPUTER ASKS THE OPERATOR IF HE WANTS WHITE OR BLACK.
BLACK ALWAYS STARTS AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN AND ALWAYS MOVES FIRST.
