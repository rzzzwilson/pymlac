This program is a smart, interactive disassembler for IMLAC binary files,
papertape or TTY.

It is designed to allow the user to read in a *.ptp or *.tty file, which
may then be interacted with:
. change MAIN to DISPLAY instruction set and vice versa
. add labels where appropriate
. change DATA to ASCII pseudo-ops and vice versa
