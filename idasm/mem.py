"""
This module implements the 'mem' object and access routines.

A 'mem' object is a dictionary with the form:

{ address: (code, op, fld, labcount, ref, type, cycle),
  address: (code, op, fld, labcount, ref, type, cycle),
   ...
}

where address    is the address of the data (integer)
      code       is the code value at the address (integer)
      op         is the opcode (string)
      fld        is the instruction field (string)
      labcount   is the number of references to this address (integer)
      ref        is a flag to show if this word references another (boolean)
      type       is type of processed instruction 'm' for main
                                                  'd' for display
                                                  None for none
      cycle      is the cycle number when this word was processed
